            Analyzing Text URLs with NLP
The concept of analyzing "text URLs" with NLP (Natural Language Processing) is interesting, but it requires clarification on what exactly constitutes a "text URL." Here are two possible interpretations:

URLs Containing Descriptive Text:

Some URLs contain words that describe the content of the webpage. For example, "stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/assign2.html" includes terms like "stanford," "jurafsky," "slp3," and "assign2" which could be analyzed with NLP.
NLP techniques could be used to:
Extract keywords and topics from the URL text.
Identify sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) based on the chosen words.
Categorize the URL based on the extracted information (e.g., educational resource, news article).
